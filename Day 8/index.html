    <p>In a small village called Sonapur, surrounded by green fields and tall palm trees, lived a kind and hardworking farmer named Rohit. He was known by everyone in the village, not just for his strong hands or the best crops, but for his good heart.
    Rohit had inherited a small piece of land from his father. Every morning, before the sun rose, he would walk barefoot to his fields. He spoke to his crops like they were friends, watered them with care, and made sure no plant ever went dry. He believed, “If you treat the land with love, it will feed you with joy.”
    Unlike many others, Rohit never left the village to find work in the city. “This land is my home,” he would say. “Here, I have everything I need.”</p>
    <p>But one year, things changed.</p>
    <p>The rains didn’t come. The sun was hotter than ever. Cracks appeared in the soil, and crops began to die. Many farmers packed their bags and left the village, hoping to find jobs in towns. But Rohit stayed.
    He didn’t lose hope.Using the little savings he had, Rohit dug a small pond in the corner of his field to collect rainwater. He learned how to plant crops that needed less water. He even started growing vegetables that he could sell every week in the local market.</p>
    <p>At first, people laughed at him. “What can one man do?” they said.

But slowly, Rohit’s fields turned green again. His vegetables grew fresh and healthy. Soon, people from nearby villages came to ask how he did it. Rohit welcomed them all with a smile and taught them everything he had learned.

In time, the village changed. Farmers returned. New ponds were built. New crops were planted. All because one man didn’t give up.

Rohit never asked for praise. For him, seeing the fields full of life was the greatest reward.

And so, in the heart of Sonapur, the people say, “When you walk through our green fields, you’re walking through Rohit’s dream.”</p>
