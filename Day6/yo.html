        <p>Cardio exercise, short for cardiovascular exercise, is any physical activity that increases your heart rate and breathing while engaging large muscle groups. It strengthens the heart and lungs, improves blood circulation, and boosts energy levels. Regular cardio helps burn calories, supports weight loss, improves endurance, and reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure.<br>
        <br>Popular cardio workouts include running, brisk walking, cycling, swimming, jumping rope, dancing, and HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training).<br> You can do cardio anywhereâ€”at the gym, outside, or at home with minimal equipment.
        <br>Health experts recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio per week, along with strength training two times per week.
        <br>Cardio not only benefits your physical health but also improves mood, reduces stress, and enhances sleep. Whether you're a beginner or advanced, cardio is essential for a balanced, healthy lifestyle. Start moving today!</p>
