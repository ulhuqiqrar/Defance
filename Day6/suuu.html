         <h3>Balanced Diet</h3>
    </div>
     <p>A balanced diet provides the nutrients your body needs to function properly. It includes a variety of foods in the right proportions to maintain energy, support growth, and promote overall health. Key components include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water.</p>
     <p>Carbohydrates (from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) provide energy. Proteins (from lean meat, beans, eggs, and dairy) help build and repair tissues. Healthy fats (from nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil) support brain health and hormone function. Vitamins and minerals (from a variety of fruits and vegetables) boost immunity and metabolic processes.</p>
    <p>A good rule is to fill half your plate with vegetables and fruits, one-quarter with lean proteins, and one-quarter with whole grains. Limit processed foods, added sugars, and excessive salt.</p>
    <p>Drinking enough water and practicing portion control are also essential. A balanced diet, combined with exercise, leads to a healthier, stronger body.</p>
